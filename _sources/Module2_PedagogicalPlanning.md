# 2. AI-Enhanced Pedagogical-Didactic Planning
*Strategic and intentional groundwork for teaching*

This module focuses on the strategic and intentional groundwork for teaching. It involves defining course goals and learning outcomes, identifying the audience and context, selecting appropriate pedagogical approaches, choosing educational technologies and AI-enhanced tools, aligning with institutional and ethical guidelines, and creating the course syllabus. You will explore how generative AI can assist with tasks like drafting learning outcomes using frameworks such as Bloom's Taxonomy and generating draft policies. <p>

> **Note:** All prompts that you use from this module onwards should be made within your AI Workspace, because this will ensure that you build upon the project you created and all developments are consistent with the instructions provided and knowledge base uploaded.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this module, participants will be able to:

- Draft and refine course goals and measurable learning outcomes using Bloom’s Taxonomy.
- Generate learner profiles, identify audience and context.
- Select pedagogical approaches aligned with outcomes and AI-enhanced teaching strategies.
- Choose appropriate AI tools and technologies for planning, delivery, and assessment.
- Align course elements with institutional and ethical guidelines.
- Use AI to draft, audit, and refine complete syllabus documents.
- Integrate prompt engineering and context engineering in planning workflows.

## 2.1 Define Course Goals and Learning Outcomes

### Purpose
Use AI to generate, refine, align, and audit learning outcomes across cognitive levels.

**Prompt Template — Instructional + Role-Based**
```
You are a higher-education instructional designer. 
Propose the course goals and generate 4–6 measurable learning outcomes for a course titled [Course Name].
Use Bloom’s taxonomy across different levels and focus on skills related to [insert skills].
Present results in a table: Outcome | Bloom Level | Example Assessment.
```

> **Note:** In the prompt above you can add or attach a course description or materials to guide the model in the creation of the learning outcomes. These contents could alternatively be added as files in your workspace (project).

**Additional Prompt Variant — Alignment Check**
```
Check whether the learning outcomes below align with Bloom’s taxonomy levels.
Identify any non-measurable verbs and suggest revisions.

### Institutional Policies
The general FGCU AI use policies are available at the link below: 
https://www.fgcu.edu/about/leadership/officeoftheprovost/generative-ai

The following files contain the general FGCU policies for GenAI use. Download them and use as the institutional policies for GenAI use. <br>
[Student_Code_of_Conduct](./Data/Regulation4002_Student_Code_of_Conduct.pdf) <br>
[General_FGCU_GenAI_Policies](./Data/GenerativeAIandFGCUTeachingandLearning.pdf) <br>
[Core_Syllabus_Policies_Statements](./Data/CoreSyllabusPolicyStatements.pdf) <br>

> **Note:** These documents should be added to the course personalized assistant and workspace (project) so that they become part of the knowledge base to be used in future interactions and developments.

**Prompt Template — Few-Shot + Document Grounding**
```
Using the AI use policy examples below and the institutional policy documents attached,
draft an “AI Use Policy” for the course [Course Title] that incorporates transparency, accountability, and fairness.

Examples of AI use policies for learning:

## 2.7 Updates to Your AI Workspace and Personalized Assistant

This section summarizes the main updates to your **AI Workspace (Project)** and **Course Personalized Assistant (PA)** to ensure both tools evolve consistently as you progress in this program.

### A. Updates to Your AI Workspace (Project)

Your Workspace is the persistent memory environment that stores course materials, policies, templates, prompts, and all artifacts created during this program. After completing Module 2, apply the updates below.

1. **Upload New Files to the Workspace Knowledge Base:** institutional AI policies, course syllabus, optional additional materials (e.g., accreditation requirements, reading lists, etc.)
2. **Update Workspace Instructions:** modify the Project’s instruction block to reflect new responsibilities.

Add under **How You Work**:
```
- Use uploaded institutional GenAI policies as primary references for all policy‑related outputs.
- Ensure alignment between learning outcomes, activities, pedagogical approaches, and assessments.
- Audit syllabi for internal consistency across dates, expectations, and learning outcomes.
```
Add under **Capabilities**:
```
- Learning outcome alignment checks
- Pedagogical model recommendations
- Syllabus generation, auditing, and refinement
- Policy drafting grounded in institutional documents
- Mapping outcomes → activities → assessments
```
Add under **Behaviors**:
```
- Flag inconsistencies or missing elements and suggest revisions.
- Reflect the institution GenAI policies when generating or updating course materials.
```
> **Note:** If the model you are using restricts the amount of information you can add as instructions in your workspace, then prompt an AI model to summarize the instructions for you.

### B. Updates to Your Course Personalized Assistant (PA)

Your PA becomes a more accurate and responsible tutor by integrating new materials and constraints.

1. **Upload New Files to the PA Knowledge Base:** syllabus, approved GenAI Use Policy, course learning outcomes, weekly schedule, institutional GenAI policy documents.
2. **Update PA Instructions:**

Add under **Core Role / Mission**:
```
- Use only uploaded course materials when answering student questions.
- Reference the GenAI Use Policy whenever students ask about AI usage.
```
Add under **Behaviors**:
```
- Cite relevant sections of the syllabus when responding to student questions.
- If the question touches academic integrity or unclear areas, respond:  
  ‘I may need more context or the original file. Please refer to the syllabus or ask your instructor.’
```
Add under **Safety & Boundaries**:
```
- Never provide answers to graded assignments or exams.
- Redirect users to the instructor if they seek prohibited support.
```

3. **Add New Conversation Starters for Students:**
```
Explain the learning outcomes of this course at beginner and advanced levels.
```
```
Summarize the policies on how AI may be used in this course.
```
```
How do the learning outcomes connect to our assignments?
```

### C. Workflow Adjustments Going Forward

**1. All Module 2+ prompts must be issued inside the Workspace**
To ensure:
- Document grounding  
- Consistency across versions  
- Accurate policy integration  
- Alignment across modules  

**2. Build incremental outputs instead of isolated chats (each chat should represent one specific set of actions)**
Examples:
- Draft → revise → audit → finalize  
- Outcomes → pedagogy → assessments → syllabus integration  

**3. Use the PA strictly for student‑facing support** <p>
Workspace = design environment <p> 
PA = learning support environment  

**4. Update both tools continuously**
As you progress through Modules 3–8, upload:
- Slides  
- Assignments  
- Activity plans  
- Updated schedules  
- Assessment rubrics  
- Course feedback summaries  

### D. Summary Table of Required Updates

| Component | Required Update | Purpose |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| **Workspace Knowledge Base** | Upload policies, syllabus drafts, LOs, learner profiles, pedagogical mappings | Grounded, consistent outputs |
| **Workspace Instructions** | Add alignment, auditing, and policy‑compliance behaviors | Improve quality and coherence |
| **PA Knowledge Base** | Add syllabus, policies, LOs, schedule | Accurate student guidance |
| **PA Instructions** | Add boundaries, policy references | Responsible and safe use |
| **Conversation Starters** | Add LO, policy, and schedule prompts | Direct student guidance |
| **Workflow** | Use Workspace for all prompts | Preserve continuity and alignment |
