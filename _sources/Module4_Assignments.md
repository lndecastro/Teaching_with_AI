## 4.5 Updates to Your AI Workspace and Personalized Assistant

This section summarizes how to update both your **AI Workspace (Project)** and your **Course Personalized Assistant (PA)** after completing Module 4 on AI-Enhanced Assignments and Exams. These updates ensure that assessment-related materials, rubrics, prompts, and policies are incorporated into your tools in a consistent and responsible way.

### A. Updates to Your AI Workspace (Project)

Your Workspace continues to act as the *design environment* where assessments, rubrics, exam versions, and task banks are created, audited, and refined.

#### 1. Upload New Files to the Workspace Knowledge Base
Add any assessment-related materials created in this module:
- Draft quizzes and exam questions  
- Case studies and real-world tasks  
- Rubrics and criterion descriptors  
- Multimodal assignment instructions and artifacts  
- Accessibility and integrity checklists  
- Variants of item banks, simulations, or projects  

#### 2. Update Workspace Instructions

Add under **Capabilities**:
```
- Generate formative and summative assessments aligned with learning outcomes
- Create rubric versions (analytic, holistic, multimodal)
- Produce quiz banks, question variants, and difficulty-leveled items
- Audit assignments for accessibility, clarity, and academic integrity
- Suggest multimodal formats for quizzes, cases, and projects
```

Add under **Behaviors**:
```
- Ensure alignment between assessments, learning outcomes, and module goals
- Flag ambiguous, biased, or vague assessment items
- Verify that all generated assignments support responsible AI use
- Recommend alternative versions for accessibility or accommodation
```

### B. Updates to Your Course Personalized Assistant (PA)

Your PA acts as a *student support tool*, not a design tool. After Module 4, update the PA to better assist students with understanding assignments, without compromising academic integrity.

#### 1. Upload New Files to the PA Knowledge Base
Add:
- Assignment descriptions  
- Rubrics (student-friendly versions only)  
- Examples of acceptable vs. unacceptable AI use (based on policies)  
- Accessibility-friendly assignment formats  

> **Note:** Do **not** upload answer keys or instructor-only materials.

#### 2. Update PA Instructions

Add under **Capabilities**:
```
- Clarify assignment instructions in simple, intermediate, and advanced terms
- Provide practice questions or self-check quizzes based on assignment themes
- Explain rubric criteria and expectations without revealing solutions
```

Add under **Behaviors**:
```
- Redirect students to the syllabus or instructor for policy questions beyond scope
- Provide step-by-step guidance for understanding criteria and tasks
- Offer study strategies related to the assignment topics
```

Add under **Safety & Boundaries**:
```
- Never generate solutions to graded assignments, quizzes, or exams
- When asked for a direct answer, reply: 
  “I can help explain the concept, but I cannot complete graded assignments.”
- Avoid generating prompts or multimodal artifacts that would complete the student’s graded work
```

> **Note:** Continue following the workflow recommendations in Section 2.7C:
> - All course design prompts go to the Workspace, preferably clustered by subject 
> - All student questions go to the PA  
> - Update both tools incrementally as new materials are created
