# Teaching with AI

Welcome to the **Teaching with AI Program**, part of the FGCU AI Academy led by the Dendritic Institute for Human-Centered AI & Data Science at Florida Gulf Coast University. This program is designed for faculty and instructors seeking **practical, hands-on methods for integrating Generative AI tools throughout the teaching and learning cycle**. Unlike pedagogical or learning-science programs, which are covered separately in the Academy, **this training focuses on the instrumental and operational use of AI**.

## Disclaimer
This training is intended to demonstrate the capabilities of generative AI tools in educational contexts. It is not an endorsement of using AI-generated content without human expertise, oversight, or academic judgment, nor is it a prescriptive guide for its use. Instructors remain fully responsible for:
- Curating and validating instructional content
- Disclosing when and how AI tools are used
- Choosing the specific tools and models they want to use
- Ensuring the ethical, responsible, and context-appropriate integration of AI into teaching and learning

Academic content must always be aligned with the subject matter, learning objectives, institutional context and policies, and professional standards. While AI can assist in content creation and instructional design (AI-assisted), it should not replace the critical role of educators (not AI-driven).

**Model and Tool Neutrality**

Throughout this program, we present a variety of foundational models, general-purpose LLMs, and specialized AI tools designed to support teaching and learning.
We do not endorse or receive sponsorship from any of the vendors, platforms, or products mentioned. Our emphasis on foundational and general-purpose models is intentional: it ensures that instructors develop transferable skills and learn how to use AI for teaching independently of any specific vendor, interface, or model-specific feature.

Participants are free and encouraged to use any AI model or tool of their preference, including alternatives not mentioned here, so long as they meet instructional needs and comply with institutional policies.

**How This Program and Jupyter Book Were Created**

This program and Jupyter Book were created through a rigorous, human-led process in which generative AI served as an assistive tool for drafting, ideation, and organization. All content was curated, complemented, reviewed, revised, and validated by the instructor to ensure pedagogical integrity, accuracy, and alignment with institutional policies. This iterative co-development process models the responsible, transparent, and human-centered use of AI advocated throughout this training.

## 3. Structure and Approach
*A multi-layered, workflow-driven program for operational AI integration in higher education*  

The **Teaching with AI Program** is built as a *practical, operational, and iterative system* for integrating generative AI into every phase of the teaching and learning cycle. Unlike pedagogical theory–oriented programs, this course focuses on how instructors actually use AI tools systematically, responsibly, and efficiently within real teaching workflows.

Across eight modules, instructors progressively build two persistent tools:

- **The AI Workspace (Project)** – your *design and development environment* for planning, creating, auditing, and improving course materials. The main platforms to be used to create AI workspaces are ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Grok).
- **The Course Personalized Assistant (PA)** – your *student-facing AI tutor* for explanations, study support, and assignment clarification (without solving graded tasks). The main platforms to be used to create PAs are Custom GPTs, Claude Artifacts, Gemini Gems, and CoPilot Agents.

![Core Operational Tools](./Data/MM_Assets.png)

The entire program is structured as a **guided transformation of your teaching practice**, with each module updating, refining, and expanding these tools.

### 3.1 A Process-Based, End-to-End Framework

### 3.2 A Multimodal, Multi-Tool Ecosystem Approach  

Throughout the program, participants develop fluency with multiple LLM ecosystems, including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, NotebookLM, SciSpace, Gamma, Canva, Grok, and much more.  

The logic behind this approach is:

- Different tools have different strengths (e.g., Claude for artifacts, Gemini for images, Perplexity for cited research, NotebookLM for grounded synthesis).
- Instructors learn to select suitable tools for each stage of their teaching workflow.
- The program models a platform-agnostic AI practice, reflecting real academic and industry environments.

In each module, tool usage is contextualized:

- Design/development tasks occur in the Workspace.  
- Student explanations and scaffolding occur through the PA.  
- Research synthesis is handled by tools like Perplexity Academic, Consensus, SciSpace.  
- Multimodal production uses tools like Gamma, Canva Magic Studio, or Claude Artifacts.

### 3.3 Progressive Building of Two Core AI Systems  
#### **A. The AI Workspace (Project)**  
A persistent, memory-enabled environment that stores:

- syllabus, schedule, policies  
- assignments, rubrics, templates  
- slides, notes, readings  
- datasets and sample materials  

It becomes the *hub* for:

- consistent document-grounded content creation  
- mapping learning outcomes to activities and assessments  
- generating variants, versions, improvements  
- auditing alignment, accessibility, and integrity  
- tracking revisions across course iterations  

#### **B. The Personalized Assistant (PA)**  
Your course’s “AI tutor”, designed with:

- explicit safety and academic integrity rules  
- multi-level explanation capabilities  
- ability to reference syllabus and course files  
- structured guidance for assignments, without completing them  
- weekly study plans, flashcards, glossaries, FAQs, diagrams  

The PA grows each module as student-facing materials are created.

### 3.4 The Program’s Instructional Approach  

**1. Short theory → hands-on practice**  
Each module begins with a concise conceptual introduction, followed by intensive practice using real course materials.

**2. Prompt Templates, Patterns & Meta-Prompting**  
Each module offers different types of prompt engineering techniques, enabling instructors to adapt workflows to various LLMs.

**3. Cross-Model Comparison & Verification**  
Participants:
- compare AI outputs from multiple tools  
- annotate differences  
- use Workspace or PA to diagnose errors  
- refine outputs with iterative prompting  

This builds *critical AI literacy*, not just production skills.

**4. Authentic, Product-Oriented Workflows**  
Each module ends with concrete artifacts, such as syllabi, class plans, slide decks, assessments and rubrics, study guides, reflective memos, SPoI instruments, and improvement dashboards. These can be deployed directly in the participants’ actual courses.

### 3.5 Continuous Improvement & Versioning

A distinctive component of the program is **longitudinal improvement**, supported through AI:

- Every version of the course is recorded in the Workspace.  
- AI identifies recurring issues or patterns.  
- Revised assessments, slides, and policies are iteratively generated.  
- A reflective practice notebook grows over time.  

This enables sustained teaching innovation, not just a one-time redesign.

### 3.6 What Makes This Program Unique?

- End-to-end workflow integration (planning → improvement)  
- Two persistent AI systems built step-by-step  
- Cross-tool literacy rather than platform dependence  
- Multimodal content generation across the curriculum  
- Evidence-based and research-aligned AI practices  
- Real teaching artifacts produced in every module  
- Explicit guardrails for academic integrity and responsible AI use

This program is not a typical “how to use AI” workshop. It is a complete transformation of your teaching ecosystem, powered by structured, responsible, and human-centered AI.

### 3.7 Operational Integration

The final Mind Map was drawn using Napkin.ai. 

![Program Operational Integration](./Data/MM_OperationalIntegration.png)

## 4. Responsible and Ethical AI Use in Teaching

The program ensures that AI outputs are always:

- aligned with institutional policies and student code of conduct
- used with transparency and citation  
- designed to *support*, not replace, human expertise  
- compliant with integrity and accessibility requirements  

Every workflow explicitly distinguishes between:

- Instructor tools (Workspace)  
- Student tools (PA, NotebookLM)  
- Prohibited uses (grading keys, exam answers, private notes in PA)  

Generative AI expands what instructors can create, automate, and personalize, but it must be used responsibly. Ethical teaching with AI requires transparency, accuracy, respect for student agency, and alignment with institutional policies. In your Teaching with AI journey you should follow some guiding principles:

### 4.1 Transparency

- Disclose how you use AI to create instructional materials, assessments, or feedback.  
- Inform students when AI is used in the course and under what conditions.  
- Document prompts or workflows when required by policy or good practice.

### 4.2 Academic Integrity

- AI should support, *not complete*, assessments meant to measure student learning.  
- Students must understand what forms of AI assistance are allowed, restricted, or prohibited.  
- Instructor-facing AI tools must not be shared with students if they contain grading keys, instructor notes, or assessment logic.

### 4.3 Accuracy and Verification

AI outputs may contain:
- factual errors  
- hallucinated citations  
- oversimplifications  
- biased assumptions  

**Good practice:**
- Verify all AI-generated content before using it in class.  
- Cross-check claims, examples, code, or datasets.  
- Revise outputs to align with course standards and context.

### 4.4 Equity and Accessibility

AI can help:
- produce multimodal formats  
- translate content  
- adapt readability  
- generate alternative explanations  

However:
- Ensure that AI tools do not disadvantage students with limited access.  
- Provide non-AI alternatives when appropriate.  
- Protect student privacy and avoid requiring external accounts unless approved by the institution.

### 4.5 Human Judgment Leads

AI should enhance, not replace, your expertise. Responsible teaching with AI requires:
- pedagogical decisions made by the instructor  
- deliberate alignment with outcomes  
- continuous monitoring of AI accuracy  
- thoughtful design of assessments that preserve learning integrity  

### 4.6 Follow Institutional Policies

Institutional generative AI policies usually outline expectations for:
- ethical use  
- academic integrity  
- student conduct  
- instructor responsibilities  

Always review these documents when designing AI-enhanced materials or policies.

### 4.7 Data Privacy and Protection

Using AI tools in teaching must align with privacy regulations and safeguard student information.

- **Do not upload personally identifiable student information (PII)**—such as names, email addresses, student IDs, grades, demographic data, or identifiable excerpts of student work—into external AI tools unless they are institutionally approved and FERPA-compliant.  
- When using AI for grading or feedback generation, **anonym**

## 5. How to Use This Jupyter Book
*A workflow-oriented guide for navigating the Teaching with AI program*

This Jupyter Book is designed not as a linear textbook, but as an **interactive, modular, and artifact-generating environment** that accompanies the Teaching with AI program. It functions as your reference manual, prompt library, workspace guide, and teaching-development companion throughout Modules 1–8.

### 5.3 How to Integrate the Book With Your AI Workspace and PA 
The Jupyter Book works best when paired with your **AI Workspace (Project)** to be created in Module 1. The book contains numerous **student-facing prompts** designed specifically for your PA. Whenever you see simplified rubrics, assignment explanations, study strategies, self-assessment checklists, flashcards, and FAQs, these can be copy-pasted into your PA’s instruction block or provided directly to students.

**Important:**  
Workspace = instructor-facing design space  
PA = student-facing guidance tool  
Never upload instructor-only materials into the PA. The Jupyter Book points out exactly which components can safely be shared with students.

### 5.4 Using the Prompts Effectively  
Each module includes a set of prompts which requires some best practices:

- Always adapt placeholders (e.g., [Course Title], [Topic], [Paste Assignment]).  
- When possible, ground prompts in uploaded files.  
- Ask for variations to compare outputs.  
- Use revision loops: draft → audit → improve → finalize.

### 5.5 Using the Exercises as Production Tasks  
Every module ends with production-oriented exercises. These are not generic activities—they are **designed to produce real components** for your actual course.

Examples:

- Module 2 → generate learning outcomes and a syllabus draft  
- Module 3 → produce a 90-minute class plan and slide deck  
- Module 4 → create a case study, rubric, and multimodal assignment  
- Module 5 → build active-learning activities with AI augmentation  
- Module 6 → design study guides and PA workflows  
- Module 7 → generate rubric-based assessments and feedback  
- Module 8 → design SPoI forms and reflective improvement plans
