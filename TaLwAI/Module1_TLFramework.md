# 1. The Teaching with AI Framework

The **Teaching with AI Framework** provides a structured, operational view of how generative AI can be integrated into each phase of the teaching process. Rather than altering pedagogy, it highlights where AI can add efficiency, creativity, and support across planning, design, delivery, assessment, student support, and reflection.

This module provides the foundation for the instrumental use of Generative AI (GenAI) across the entire teaching workflow. It is built upon the background knowledge from the **AI Literacy Program** (Prompt Engineering, Context Engineering, and Foundational Models).  

Unlike pedagogical programs, this module focuses **not** on pedagogy or teaching theory, but on **how to operationally integrate GenAI tools** to plan, design, deliver, assess, support, and improve your course. In this module you will learn the seven steps of the framework, create your course workspace and personalized assistant.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the AI-Enhanced Teaching Workflow, a practical framework for integrating GenAI throughout the instructional cycle.
- Explain how AI tools support planning, design, delivery, assessment, student support, and reflection.
- Create your AI Workspace using ChatGPT Projects, Claude Projects, Perplexity Spaces, or Gemini/NotebookLM equivalents.
- Build your AI Personalized Assistant to serve as a course tutor or helper for your students.
- Understand how foundational models and multimodal LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, etc.) shape what is possible in teaching.
- Recognize where prompt engineering and context engineering (from AI Literacy) apply inside the teaching workflow.
- Begin developing persistent GenAI tools that will grow with you throughout the program.

### Modules Overview

The picture below contains a summary of the main modules of our framework and the main tools and deliverables of each step. 

![Modules Overview](./Data/TeachingWorkflow.png)

## 1.2 Background GenAI Knowledge for Teaching with AI  

To use AI instrumentally in education, instructors must understand:

### Prompt Engineering
- Prompts = instructions to the model  
- Structured prompting leads to predictable, high‑quality outputs  
- Prompt patterns (e.g., instructional, role, chain-of-thought, few-shot)
- **Anatomy of a Prompt**: Instruction, Context, Input Data, Output Format
- **Meta-prompt**: prompts used to create, structure or refine other prompts

### Context Engineering 
- Designing the *whole environment* around the prompt  
- Roles, audience, tone, documents, constraints  
- Retrieval-augmented workflows  
- Essential for building **AI Workspaces** and **Personalized Assistants**

### Foundational Models & LLM Ecosystems 
- Multimodal LLMs, such as, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, Copilot, Grok 
- Understanding tool ecosystems determines what is possible in teaching  
- Strengths, limitations, and best-fit teaching use cases

You are strongly encouraged to have a look at our **AI Literacy program**, which will guide you through the basics of Prompt and Context Engineering, and also foundational models and LLM ecosystems. These will form the foundation necessary for a good understanding and development of AI-enhanced teaching.

## 1.3 Creating Your AI Workspace  
*A persistent, structured environment for your course*

In this program, you will create a **Teaching with AI Workspace**, which will evolve across Modules 1–8. 

> **Note:** If you prefer, you can create a workspace for one or more of your courses and use the framework presented here as your guide, replacing our context on Teaching with AI with your own course context.

You may choose any platform, for example:

- ChatGPT Projects  
- Claude Projects  
- Perplexity Spaces  
- Gemini + NotebookLM hybrid workspace  
- Microsoft Copilot Pages  
- xAI Grok Projects

### Purpose of the Workspace

Your AI Workspace will:

- Store all course files (e.g., syllabus, slides, assignments, datasets)  
- Maintain persistent context across sessions  
- Serve as a hub for multi-step workflows and collaboration 
- Support course revision and continuous improvement  
- Act as the design environment for your Personalized Assistant

```

> **Note:** If the model you are using restricts the amount of information you can add as instructions in your workspace, then prompt an AI model to summarize the instructions for you.

#### Example Prompts to start using your AI Workspace
Begin using your workspace as a persistent and collaborative environment, trying prompts like:

```
I am beginning to design a new course/program on [Topic]. 
Help me clarify the purpose and course outcomes for graduate students and researchers. 
```
```
Based on the initial course idea, propose several possible structures or models for how this course could be organized. 
```
```
Help me identify the key decisions and information still required to begin formal course design. 
```

## 1.5 Program Summary

The Mind Map below was generated using NotebookLM and printed with Napkin. It provides an overview of the Teaching with AI program. The program is broken down into seven sequential phases that structure how generative AI is applied across the entire teaching process. The other mind map branches detail the essential tools, foundational knowledge, and guiding principles that frame the entire AI-Integrated instructional cycle.
