```

### Example Activity 1. AI‑Augmented Think–Pair–Share

#### Overview
Students individually explore a question with an AI assistant, then pair to compare and critique their AI‑assisted reasoning, and finally share insights with the class.

#### Step‑by‑Step
1. **Think (5 minutes)**  
   Students ask an AI tool the following prompt:  
   ```
   Explain the concept of [Course Topic] in simple terms. 
   Then provide a real-world example and a misconception students often have.
   ```  
   Students review the AI output and annotate:  
   - What parts are clear?  
   - What parts need correction?  
   - What would *you* add?

2. **Pair (5 minutes)**  
   Students compare their annotated answers.  
   They must identify:  
   - One difference in explanations  
   - One misconception flagged by AI  
   - One improvement they propose together  

3. **Share (5–10 minutes)**  
   Pairs report to the class:  
   - How the AI helped  
   - Where the AI struggled  
   - What they learned by comparing explanations  

#### Learning Outcomes
- Improve conceptual clarity  
- Practice evaluating AI-generated content  
- Strengthen metacognitive skills  

### Example Activity 2. AI Debate Partner  

#### Overview
Students debate an issue where the AI acts as a **role-based debating partner**, allowing students to practice argumentation, critique, and evidence use.

**Prompt for Students**
```
You are an expert who argues *in favor* of the position:
[Insert debate statement]

Provide:
1) A clear argument,
2) Evidence-based support,
3) One counterargument you expect from the opposing side.
```

Then students ask:
```
Now switch roles and argue *against* the same statement.
```

#### Debrief Questions
- Which side did AI argue more convincingly?  
- Did the AI hallucinate evidence?  
- How would you strengthen or refute its claims?  

#### Instructor-Led Group Exchange
Students form groups of three:
- Student A: presents one side
- Student B: presents the opposing side
- Student C: acts as the evaluator/referee 

### Example Activity 3. AI Error Analysis  

#### Overview
Students analyze AI-generated mistakes to deepen understanding and improve critical evaluation. This is powerful for math, programming, statistics, logic, or technical writing.

## 5.3 Employ Technology and AI Tools for Content Delivery

### Purpose
Leverage (academic) generative AI tools to present, demonstrate, simulate or interact with course content in diverse formats. This section focuses on some GenAI tools and workflows that support content delivery, multimodal presentation, visualization, and real-time interaction. We present here some sample tools and use cases to illustrate different possibilities.

### Illustrative Case Study
The open-access paper titled *Feedback sources in essay writing: peer-generated or AI-generated feedback?* investigates the **quality of feedback provided by ChatGPT compared to peer feedback** on graduate students' argumentative essays. The findings revealed that peer feedback was generally of higher quality, particularly in identifying specific issues within the essays, while ChatGPT provided more descriptive feedback.  The researchers found no significant overall correlation between essay quality and feedback quality from either source, suggesting a potential complementary role for both ChatGPT and peers in the feedback process, which could help reduce teacher workload.
